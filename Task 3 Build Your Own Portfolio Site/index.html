    <h2>Hello, I'm Zeeshan ðŸ‘‹</h2>
    <p>I'm a Computer Science student passionate about development & design.</p>

  <section id="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>II am a dedicated and enthusiastic student currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. With a strong passion for technology and innovation, I am especially interested in web development, programming, and cybersecurity. Over time, Iâ€™ve developed a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and C++, and continue to build on these skills through academic projects and personal learning.

My journey into the world of technology started with curiosity and a desire to understand how things work behind the scenes. This curiosity has grown into a commitment to mastering software development and using it to solve real-world problems. I enjoy experimenting with code, creating small apps and tools, and constantly challenging myself to learn more.

In addition to my technical skills, I believe in continuous improvement and personal growth. I am a quick learner, a good communicator, and someone who works well both independently and in a team. Whether Iâ€™m collaborating on a class project or exploring new technologies on my own, I strive to bring creativity, logic, and determination to everything I do.

Outside of academics, I am also interested in design, digital art, and contributing to open-source projects. I aim to grow into a well-rounded developer who not only writes functional code but also builds thoughtful, user-friendly experiences. My goal is to use my knowledge to create meaningful technology and to contribute positively to the tech community.
